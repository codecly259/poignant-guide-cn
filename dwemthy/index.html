        <h1>You Are A Rabbit, UNTIL!</h1>

        <p><span>In this game, you are a rabbit who is going to die.  A dragon is going to do it.  Deep in Dwemthy's Array.</span></p>

    <p><span>More on this code in a moment.</span></p>

    <p><span>Please, never ask who Dwemthy is.  Obviously he is a mastermind and would never disclose his location or true identity.
    He has sired dynasties.  He has set living ogres aflame.  Horses everywhere smell him at all times.  Most of all, he knows
    carnal pleasures.  And to think that this...</span></p>

    <p><span>This is his Array.</span></p>

    <div class="writ">
    <p><span>A scalding SEETHING LAVA infiltrates the cacauphonous ENGORGED MINESHAFTS deep within the ageless canopy of the
    DWEMTHY FOREST... chalky and nocturnal screams from the belly of the RAVENOUS WILD STORKUPINE... who eats wet
    goslings RIGHT AFTER they've had a few graham crackers and a midday nap... amidst starved hippos TECHNICALLY
    ORPHANED but truthfully sheltered by umbrellas owned jointly by car dealership conglomerates... beneath uncapped vials of mildly pulpy BLUE
    ELIXIR... which shall remain... heretofore... UNDISTURBED... DWEMTHY!!!</span></p>

    <p><span>Contrary to the ill-guided notions of certain introductory comics, DWEMTHY'S ARRAY is not a mind puzzle.  It is
    a short 60 line role-playing game that is played with Ruby metaprogramming.  The game comes from chapter six of
    <a href="../">Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby</a>.</span></p>

    <p><span><i>If you don't understand Dwemthy's Array, it is Dwemthy's fault.  He designed the game to complicate our lives
    and were it simpler, it would not be the awe-inspiring quest we've come to cherish in our arms this very hour.</i></span></p>

    <h1>Enough Elaborate Metaphor And Sly Juxtaposition, GIVE US THE CORRESPONDING CODE!</h1>
    
    <p><span>To play, you must have Ruby (the beloved programming language) on your computer.  If you don't, you must leave Dwemthy's Array immediately and never
        speak of it, except with your legal guardian to whom your life is entrusted.  If you need Ruby, please visit
        <a href="../book/expansion-pak-1.html">The Tiger's Vest</a>.</span></p>

    <p><span>Tread carefully &#0151; here is the code for DWEMTHY'S ARRAY!!</span></p>

    <h1>Rabbit Fights ScubaArgentine!</h1>

    <p><span>You cannot just go rushing into Dwemthy's Array, unseatbelted and merely
        perfumed!!  You must advance deliberately through the demonic cotillion.  Or south,
        through the thickets and labyrinth of coal.</span></p>

    <p><span>For now, let's lurk covertly through the grotto of sausage smells.  And 
        defeat the ScubaArgentine.</span></p>

    <p><span>Now use the little boomerang!</span></p>

[Your enemy hit with 28 points of damage!]
[Rabbit has died.]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p><span>For crying out loud!!  Our sample rabbit died!!</span></p>

    <p><span>Grim prospects.  I can't ask you to return to the rabbit kingdom, though.
        Just pretend like you didn't die and make a whole new rabbit.</span></p>

    <h1>The Harsh Realities of Dwemthy's Array AWAIT YOU TO MASH YOU!!</h1>

    <p><span>Once you're done playchoking the last guy with his oxygen tube, it's time
        to enter The Array.  I doubt you can do it.  You left your hatchet at home.  And
        I hope you didn't use all your bombs on the easy guy.</span></p>

    <p><span>You have six foes.</span></p>

    <p><span>These are the living, breathing monstrosities of Dwemthy's Array.  I don't
        know how they got there.  No one knows.  Actually, I'm guessing the IntrepidDecomposedCyclist
        rode his ten-speed.  But the others: NO ONE knows.</span></p>

    <p><span>If it's really important for you to know, let's just say the others were born there.
        Can we move on??</span></p>

        through your shoulder.</span></p>

    <p><span>Oh, and none of this "I'm too young to die" business.  I'm sick of that crap.
        I'm not going to have you insulting our undead young people.  They are our future.
        After our future is over, that is.</span></p>
